# Physics experiments: Kinematics & Pendulum Data Analysis

Using Jupyter Notebook, python libraries SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas, the physics lab reports on kinematics and the pendulum were produced forÂ the university lab experiments. Plotly was used to visualize the data.

A collection of notebooks crated during the physics lab experiments conducted at the university
